# Gradebook desktop

(This project is a laboratory work on the subject of "Java Language")

### Description

The use of paper student's record books for grading is available not only in Ukraine but also in many other countries. Unfortunately, the scope of the project does not allow to fully show all the possibilities of development of this database, User Interface and backend. However, based on the tasks, it was possible to create a prototype of the record book, which can fully duplicate the paper record book.
In the course of the course work was studied the design of the database from the task, and to its physical implementation. An application was also created that uses data that was added to the database at the stage of physical design.

### Technology

To create a frontend, the Java programming language is used, namely the JavaFX framework, which allows to conveniently create a User Interface for this application.

The programming language Java and Java script were used to create the backend, namely the Spring boot framework for Java and the shvidko(mine) library for Java script.

DBMS postgres is used to create a database
